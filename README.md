# Displaying Output on Seven Segment Displays

Two 7-segment displays were wired to an Arduino using two Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) to 7-segment decoders along with a potentiometer (refer to Figure 1). The two 7-segment displays were programmed to display a number between 0 and 99 based on the potentiometers output. This task was done using Tinkercad.
